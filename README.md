# Multi-Perspective Ensemble Deep Clustering for Diabetes Patient Stratification

**Author**: Novan  
**Institution**: Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember
**Course**: Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a novel multi-perspective ensemble deep clustering framework for robust patient stratification in diabetes care. The approach integrates clinical, treatment, and administrative perspectives through a consensus mechanism to identify meaningful patient subgroups for targeted interventions.

### Key Contributions

1. **Multi-Perspective Framework**: Separate clustering from clinical, treatment, and administrative viewpoints
2. **Deep Learning Integration**: VAE-based feature learning for clinical patterns
3. **Adaptive Consensus**: Confidence-weighted ensemble mechanism
4. **Clinical Validation**: Comprehensive validation with outcome analysis
5. **MLOps Pipeline**: Reproducible experiment tracking and deployment-ready model
